BUGS
====

Turns out that a few things don't work.

- No commands involving CTRL-L work, since emulating it with Colemak
  CTRL-I breaks the Tab key, and using it on the right-hand side of
  mappings doesn't work. Some commands are approximated:
  - <Leader>l executes :redraw! in Normal mode.
  - <Leader>l is mapped to CTRL-\ CTRL-N in Insert mode.

- No commands involving CTRL-P work, since emulating it would require
  remapping the nonexistent CTRL-[semicolon]. Some commands are
  substituted:
  - <Leader>p is mapped to CTRL-P in Insert and Command-line modes.
  - <C-R><Leader>p is mapped to CTRL-R CTRL-P in Insert and Command-line
    modes.
  - <C-R><C-R><Leader>p is mapped to CTRL-R CTRL-R CTRL-P in
    Command-line mode.

- Colons are mapped to 'P's in several unfortunate places, resulting in
  unwanted attempts to paste instead of executing Ex commands:
  - The internal execution of @: (and presumably @{a-z}, @@, and
    any other normal mode commands that execute Ex commands).
  - Mappings and menu definitions that try to run Ex commands.

- Specifying mark names after ` and ' is subject to langmap, but not
  after g` and g'. So ` followed by the key to the left of M jumps to
  mark N, but g` and the same key jumps to mark K.

- The 'q' command records Colemak keystrokes instead of QWERTY ones.
  Fortunately, langmap seems to translate them correctly as they're
  played back, but the registers still contain the wrong characters.

- CTRL + the key to the left of the apostrophe key still produces
  CTRL-O.
