" ##### MAPPINGS #######################################################

" The langmap option doesn't apply to insert and command-line modes, so
" we use mappings instead. The only problem is that langmap DOES apply
" to mappings in insert and command-line modes.
"
" For example, let's say one wants to make the chord consisting of CTRL
" and the key under the right index finger (N on Colemak) behave like it
" does on a QWERTY keyboard (J). One might think that mapping <C-N> to
" <C-J> would do the trick, but one would be mistaken. Since langmap
" kicks in during mappings, <C-N> is actually 'produced' by CTRL + the
" key to the left of M.
"
" Thus, to address the desired physical keystrokes, it seems necessary
" to target the end products of langmap, which means that we have to map
" the langmap-produced keystrokes to themselves to get QWERTY behavior.
